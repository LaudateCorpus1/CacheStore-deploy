In a new terminal:

	- cd cachestore-deploy/
	- sudo sh bin/CachestoreShell.sh
	- c = open("localhost:4200", "test")
			===> url localhost:4200 store test timeout 6000 nio false
	- listKey(c)
			===> [1 INT, 2 INT, 3 INT, 4 INT]
	- getv(c, 1)
			===> this
	- getv(c, 2)
			===> is
	- getv(c, 3)
			===> a
	- getv(c, 4)
			===> test
	- :exit
